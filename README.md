## Setup Environment

**Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate dependencies for your project. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```
**Install the dependencies**

   ```bash
   cd src
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Run the server.**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
